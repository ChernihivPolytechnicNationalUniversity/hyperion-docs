# Digital University - NPP Portal

## Project Overview

The **NPP Portal** (Науково-педагогічні працівники / University Faculty Work Portal) is a comprehensive system for managing university faculty profiles and tracking their professional activities.

- Co-authorship tracking for collaborative work
- Rating and statistics calculation per teacher and department
- Public access to faculty information and activities
- Role-based access control with four distinct user levels
