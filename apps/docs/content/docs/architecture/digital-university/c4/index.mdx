# C4 Architecture Diagrams

C4 diagrams provide multiple levels of architectural detail:

## Diagram Levels

### [System Context](system-context)
High-level view showing the system and its users/external systems.

### [Container Diagram](container-diagram)
Shows the high-level technical building blocks (applications, data stores).

## About C4

The C4 model provides a hierarchical set of diagrams:
1. **System Context** - Big picture
2. **Container** - High-level technical blocks
3. **Component** - Components within containers
4. **Code** - Class diagrams (rarely needed)
