# Digital University Documentation

Welcome to the Digital University project documentation. This site contains comprehensive architecture documentation, design decisions, and technical guidelines.

## Quick Navigation

### Architecture Documentation
- [Architecture Overview](architecture/digital-university) - System architecture and design decisions
- [ADRs](architecture/digital-university/adr) - Architecture Decision Records documenting key decisions
- [Solution Designs](architecture/digital-university/solution-designs) - Feature designs and implementation plans
- [Sequence Diagrams](architecture/digital-university/sequence) - Interaction flows and API sequences
- [ERD](architecture/digital-university/erd) - Database schema and entity relationships
- [C4 Diagrams](architecture/digital-university/c4) - System context and container views

### Standards & Guidelines
- [Agreements](agreements) - Technical standards and conventions
- [Guidelines](guidelines) - Step-by-step implementation guides
- [Process Documentation](process) - Team workflows and procedures
