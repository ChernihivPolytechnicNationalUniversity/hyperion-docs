## Active ADRs

## About ADRs

ADRs document important architectural decisions:
- **Context**: Why we needed to make a decision
- **Decision**: What we decided
- **Rationale**: Why we chose this option
- **Consequences**: Impact of the decision

ADRs are immutable - once accepted, create new ADRs to supersede rather than modifying existing ones.
