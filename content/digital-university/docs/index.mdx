# Digital University Documentation

Welcome to the Digital University project documentation. This site contains comprehensive architecture documentation, design decisions, and technical guidelines.

## Quick Navigation

### Architecture Documentation
- [Architecture Overview](./architecture/digital-university) - System architecture and design decisions
- [ADRs](./architecture/digital-university/adr) - Architecture Decision Records documenting key decisions
- [C4 Diagrams](./architecture/digital-university/c4) - System context and container views
- [ERD](./architecture/digital-university/erd) - Database schema and entity relationships
- [Solution Designs](./architecture/digital-university/solution-designs) - Feature designs and implementation plans
- [Sequence Diagrams](./architecture/digital-university/sequence) - Interaction flows and API sequences
- [Strategy](./architecture/digital-university/strategy) - Strategic planning and roadmap

### Standards & Process
- [Agreements](./agreement) - Technical standards and conventions
- [Process](./process) - Team workflows, support, and procedures

## Getting Started

### For New Team Members
1. Read the [Architecture Overview](./architecture/digital-university)
2. Review [ADR-001: Initial Architecture](./architecture/digital-university/adr/ADR-001-initial-architecture)
3. Check the [Glossary](./architecture/digital-university/glossary) for domain terminology
